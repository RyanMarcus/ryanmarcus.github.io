		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the guide. 
I&#039;d like to make a note here that may help others. I have a Logitech webcam, and use its built in microphone for Skype, and wanted to use the same one for TS. 

I had a problem when using your .asoundrc, TS gave an error when I tried to select the USB Audio wave device. I changed my .asoundrc to look like this:

pcm.headset {
	type plug
	slave.pcm &quot;hw:1,0&quot;
}

Now to find a solution for the pesky push-to-talk problem :P

That had the desired effect (i.e. TS works), but it broke Skype (Problem with audio capture, I am told). I changed my .asoundrc to look like this (adding a new capture device rather than overriding the existing headset):

pcm.headset1 {
	type plug
	slave.pcm &quot;hw:1,0&quot;
}

And made the corresponding change to the registry to point at headset1 instead of headset.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ya, that&#039;s a nasty little predicament. This is more of a WINE bug then anything, as the code in TS should look for a key press on a global scale... but it doesn&#039;t.

If you install your games into the same WINE prefix as TS, it should work because you&#039;ll be running both applications using the same input manager. I do not recommend doing this.

You should probably just use voice activation. If that really isn&#039;t an option, you may have to install TS Into all of your game&#039;s WINE prefixes!]]></description>
