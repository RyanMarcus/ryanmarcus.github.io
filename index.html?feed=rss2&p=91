		<description><![CDATA[Tiguex is still under development, but don&#039;t expect a release soon.

And yes, Frank and I do that a lot, and I&#039;m putting a stop to it right here. Frank wanted to stop doing ATB.. I said no, and made my own forums. Frank stopped making Acoma, I picked it up.

I agree with you, I was being dumb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, good. It would be a shame to see all that work go to waste, but what happened to that tigureX thingy?

Now my annoying rant:

What&#039;s with you people? OOhh I gonna stop working on this, I gonna quit programming, I gonna start again, wait, I&#039;m kidding. Humm.... I&#039;m, back. nope, gone.

How many times have you and Frank dropped projects? How many have been picked up? Hello! Just say that your current focus has temporally shifted to another project. Every time you officially kill a project people leave and/or get mad. Delaying one with a reason (like your board or want to sleep 15 hours a day) is in my mind a much better choice. Any one that gets pissed about that should try to do nothing but pick his nose for a year and see if he wants to do something else for a while.]]></description>
