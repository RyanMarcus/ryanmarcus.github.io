				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I (finally) put out a new version of Android Debate today. Functionality wise, it isn&#8217;t too much different from the previous version, but it is a lot cleaner, and you can search through judges and view their paradigms!</p>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Choose timer sounds<br />
- Progress bar!<br />
- Fully configurable times<br />
- Judge paradigms (currently they just open as links, but that will be changed in a future version)<br />
- New look and feel!
</p></blockquote>
<p>I imagine I&#8217;ll have a lot more time this summer to work on the app, and I plan on adding a lot more features, including many that integrate with <a href="http://debateresults.com">DebateResults</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out on your phones or on Google Play here: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.rmarcus.debate">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.rmarcus.debate</a>.</p>
